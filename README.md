Space Wars is  2d game made with pygame which is a library that is probably the most well known python library when it comes to making games. It’s not the most advanced or high level library, but it’s comparatively simple and easy to learn. Pygame serves as a great entry point into the world of graphics and game development, especially for beginners.
The Pygame framework includes several modules with functions for drawing graphics, playing sounds, handling mouse input, and other things that you’ll need while developing games in Python.
